echo ðŸ”§ Deployment Fix Script
echo =======================
echo.

echo The deployment was successful but you're getting "Internal Server Error"
echo This is usually due to missing directories or app not restarting properly.
echo.

echo ðŸŽ¯ Most likely causes:
echo 1. Missing tmp directory (shown in logs)
echo 2. App needs manual restart
echo 3. Environment variables not set
echo 4. File permissions issue
echo.

echo ðŸ“‹ Quick fixes to try in cPanel:
echo.
echo 1. CHECK NODE.JS APP in cPanel:
echo    âœ… Go to cPanel â†’ Node.js Apps
echo    âœ… Find your Almari2 application
echo    âœ… Click "Restart" button
echo    âœ… Verify settings:
echo       - Application Root: Almari2
echo       - Application URL: zervia.ng (or your domain)
echo       - Application Startup File: server.js
echo.

echo 2. CREATE MISSING DIRECTORIES in File Manager:
echo    âœ… Go to cPanel â†’ File Manager
echo    âœ… Navigate to /home/imsfrkmv/Almari2/
echo    âœ… Create folder: "tmp" (if missing)
echo    âœ… Create folder: "logs" (if missing)
echo    âœ… Inside tmp folder, create file: "restart.txt"
echo.

echo 3. CHECK APPLICATION LOGS:
echo    âœ… In File Manager, go to: /home/imsfrkmv/Almari2/logs/
echo    âœ… Look for "app.log" file
echo    âœ… View the file to see exact error messages
echo.

echo 4. VERIFY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (if using database/auth):
echo    âœ… In Node.js Apps, check Environment Variables section
echo    âœ… Ensure required variables are set:
echo       - DATABASE_URL (if using database)
echo       - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (if using authentication)
echo       - Any other app-specific variables
echo.

echo ðŸš¨ If you're still getting errors after trying above:
echo 1. Check the app.log file for specific error messages
echo 2. Verify all your .env variables are set in cPanel
echo 3. Make sure your domain is pointing to the right directory
echo.

echo ðŸ’¡ Your deployment files are correctly uploaded:
echo âœ… .next folder: PRE-BUILT and uploaded
echo âœ… Dependencies: INSTALLED (428 packages)  
echo âœ… Source code: SYNCHRONIZED
echo âœ… Server file: CONFIGURED
echo.

echo The issue is likely just a configuration or restart problem!
echo.
