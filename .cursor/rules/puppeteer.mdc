puppeteer-mcp
- Puppeteer solves the problem of automated browser interactions and web scraping:
  - It enables programmatic control of web browsers for testing and automation
  - Handles dynamic content loading and JavaScript execution
  - Facilitates screenshot capture and PDF generation
  - Supports automated form filling and user interaction simulation
  - Enables headless browser operations for server environments

- When encountering needs for browser automation and web scraping, always use the Puppeteer MCP server:
  - For automated testing of web applications
  - For generating PDFs of web content
  - For capturing screenshots of web pages
  - For scraping dynamic web content
  - For simulating user interactions
  - For monitoring web application behavior

- After implementing new features:
  - Use Puppeteer to verify the feature works as expected
  - Write automated tests to check functionality
  - If tests fail, debug and fix the implementation
  - Continue testing until all checks pass successfully
  - Document any edge cases or issues discovered during testing
  - Maintain test scripts for regression testing
