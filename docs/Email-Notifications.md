Your Current Tech Stack Analysis

Frontend & Backend:
•  Next.js 15.3.1 (React 19) - Full-stack framework
•  TypeScript - Type safety
•  Server Actions enabled for backend logic

Database & Authentication:
•  Supabase - PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication
•  Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
•  User management through Supabase Auth

Deployment:
•  cPanel hosting (configured for Node.js deployment)
•  Custom server setup (server.js)

Existing Notification System:
•  You already have a comprehensive in-app notification system
•  Built with Supabase database storage
•  Template-based notifications
•  Cron job system for automated notifications

Email Notification Tech Stack We'll Use

Based on your existing setup, here's exactly what we'll implement:

1. Email Service Library
•  Nodemailer (Node.js email sending library)
•  Perfect for Next.js server-side operations
•  Supports SMTP (your cPanel requirement)
•  Template support and attachments
•  Already compatible with your existing infrastructure

2. SMTP Configuration
•  cPanel SMTP settings stored in environment variables
•  Secure credential management (already following your pattern)
•  Connection pooling for performance

3. Template System
•  React Email or custom HTML templates
•  Dynamic content rendering (similar to your notification templates)
•  Consistent with your existing notification template patterns
•  Responsive email design

4. Integration Architecture

Your Current Flow:
User Action → Server Action → Supabase → In-app Notification

New Enhanced Flow:
User Action → Server Action → Supabase → In-app Notification + Email Queue → Email Sent

5. Email Queue System
•  Supabase database table for email queue (consistent with your architecture)
•  Background processing using your existing cron job system
•  Retry logic and error handling
•  Status tracking (pending, sent, failed)

6. Implementation Components

Email Service (lib/email/):
•  emailService.ts - Core SMTP service
•  templates/ - Email templates
•  queue.ts - Queue management
•  types.ts - TypeScript definitions

Integration Points:
•  Extend existing notification service
•  Add email triggers to your server actions
•  Enhance your cron job system
•  Add email preferences to user settings

7. Configuration Pattern
Following your existing pattern:

.env variables:
- SMTP_HOST=mail.yourdomain.com
- SMTP_PORT=587
- SMTP_USER=noreply@yourdomain.com
- SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password

8. Benefits of This Approach
•  Seamless integration with your existing notification system
•  Consistent architecture with your Supabase + Server Actions pattern
•  Scalable using your existing cron job infrastructure  
•  Type-safe with your TypeScript setup
•  cPanel compatible with standard SMTP

The system will extend your current notification infrastructure rather than replace it, giving you both in-app AND email notifications with a unified management system.
