## In Progress Tasks

## Future Tasks

## Implementation Plan

The database seeding implementation populates the Almari e-commerce database with test data that can be used for development and testing. The seeding process includes creating users with different roles, products across various categories, orders in different states, and other related data.

For local development, we use SQLite. For production, we generate SQL statements that can be imported into Supabase PostgreSQL database.

## Seeding to Supabase

To seed data to Supabase, follow these steps:

1. First, create the database schema by running the schema SQL file:
   - Go to the Supabase dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to the SQL Editor
   - Create a new query
   - Copy and paste the contents of `schema.sql`
   - Run the query

2. After the schema is created, run the seed data SQL:
   - Create another new query
   - Copy and paste the contents of `seed-data.sql`
   - Run the query
